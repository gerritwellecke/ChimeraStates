Some numerical integrations and plotting of the Kuramoto model in two populations of oscillators as well as the Ott-Antonsen reduction of that system.

Special thanks to the makers of the boost C++ library, you saved me the trouble of coming up with my own RK4 algorithm, and to my tutor for the great help and patience while debugging this code.
